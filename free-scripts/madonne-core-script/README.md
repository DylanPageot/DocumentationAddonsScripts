# ðŸ›  Madonne Core Script

When you use several of our scripts, you can use our MadonneCore resource, to automatically optimize the operation of our different resources by allowing a sharing of data that allows them to work.

To use MS\_Madonne\_Core, nothing is simpler, just place it with the other resources of your server and load it before the other MadonneStudio resources. No configuration required, our scripts will automatically recognize the presence of this resource, and adapt their mode of operation accordingly.&#x20;

Magical, isn't it ?
