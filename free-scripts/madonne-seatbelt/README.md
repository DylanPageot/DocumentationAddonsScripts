# ðŸš— Madonne Seatbelt

Discover today MadonneSeatbelt, a FiveM script, developed by MadonneStudio, allowing you to simulate the presence of a seat belt on board your vehicles. Highly configurable, this script will bring you a touch of realism to your FiveM server !



## **How does the script work ?**

When you get in and start a vehicle, you will be able to fasten your seat belt in order to be kept safe inside the vehicle in the vent of an accident. If you do not attach it, a small beep may sound, as in a real vehicle and a warning light will be displayed in your interface. In the event of an impact without a seat belt, you risk being thrown out of the vehicle and sustaining heavy damage.
