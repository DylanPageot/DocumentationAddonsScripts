# ðŸ›¡ Madonne PVP

Many players come to roleplay servers with the intention of harming the experience of other players, including by shooting twists and turns. MadonnePVP allows you to limit access to PVP by asking players to answer a completely personalizable quiz, using questions that you will have previously filled in.

Upon successful completion of the quiz, the player will gain access to PvP features. It is still possible for people authorized to do so, to engage the passive mode, thus disabling any damage on the entire server.
