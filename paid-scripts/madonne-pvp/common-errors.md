# Common Errors

<details>

<summary>You lack the required entitlement to use MS_Madonne_PVP</summary>

This message indicates that you do not have permission to launch the MadonnePVP resource.

The causes can be multiple. We therefore advise you to check these different points :&#x20;

* The Patreon key listed in your server.cfg does not contain a typing error.
* The Patreon key listed in your server.cfg belongs to the FiveM account that was used to purchase our resource.
* The resource has been successfully purchased in our shop.
* The Patreon key linked to my server belongs to me and does not belong to the host of my server.

However, we would like to warn you about this last point. Hosts offering Patreons keys in their offers are rarely trustworthy. This will also block the use of any resource protected by FiveM's Escrow system, without exception. We can only strongly advise you to use your own Patreon keys.
