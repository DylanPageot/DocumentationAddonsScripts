### How to use it ?

Depending on your configuration options, the script will calculate the duration of four different seasons : summer, fall, winter and spring. Depending on these different seasons, the script will calculate a longer or shorter sunshine duration while taking into account the probabilities of weather conditions consistent with your wishes.

Your players will also have the option to launch a weather report, announcing the weather for the next day in-game.
