# Script Configuration

Our goal at MadonneStudio is to offer resources with advanced configuration options, allowing you to modify our scripts as you see fit, so that they meet your needs as much as possible.

As a result, MadonnAdmin is no exception to the rule. Here are the different configuration options available to you, in the configuration files.

These configuration options will therefore be divided into several files:

* A main configuration file
* Several configuration files specific to different modules present in Madonn'Admin.

Let's see in more detail what they consist of.
