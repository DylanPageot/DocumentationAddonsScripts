## Server List

Here will be indicated the list of your servers created on Madonn'Admin. Be careful, depending on the offer (Bronze, Silver or Gold) to which you have subscribed, you will have a different maximum number of servers per community.

For each server, you will find:

* The name you gave it
* The IP address of this server: be careful, this must be exact so that the application of all Madonn'Admin features is done correctly
* The status: if the server is online or not
* The number of players and the number of staff connected
* Three buttons: a first to copy the unique token of the server (which will be used in the FiveM resource), a button to edit the server, a button to delete the server.

## Add a server

The form presented above allows you to add a new server to Madonn'Admin. This form is also the same when modifying a server already created.

Here is some important information regarding this form:

* The IP address must be correct and the server launched when registering the new server. Indeed, Madonn'Admin will check that it can connect to this IP address before registering the new data.
* The Discord Webhook of pending sanction allows you to send a message on Discord, indicating that a staff needs a superior to validate a sanction before it is applied. The message will be displayed as follows on Discord :

* The Announcement Webhook, allows you to send announcements made to the staff, from MadonnAdmin, on Discord, in a specific channel. By default, no role will be pinged, but it is possible to ping a role on Discord, by adding the ID of the role, on the field just below.
