# Manage Permissions

## Roles list per server

Each different server has a maximum number of roles depending on the chosen subscription. For each server, it is possible to obtain a summary table of the roles created, with their permissions.

From this table it is possible to modify the order and hierarchy between the different roles; as well as to modify or delete each role.

## Add a role

At the bottom of the page, a form is available to create new roles. You have the possibility to create a role for a given server, give it the name you want and a color code (hexadecimal).

You will then find all the possible and imaginable permission options within Madonn'Admin. You just have to check the ones you want to give to the role you are creating.

Be careful, some permissions are out of the ordinary:

* The temporary ban, which when checked, will ask you what is the maximum ban duration, in days, that this role can apply
* The Submarine mode, which allows you to activate its moderation mode in game, while hiding it from the players' view.
* The Massive Delete Radius, which allows you to set a maximum radius when using mass deletion in game, such as to delete vehicles or objects for example.
