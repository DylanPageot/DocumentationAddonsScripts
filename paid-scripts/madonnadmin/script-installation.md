# Script Installation

After purchasing the resource on our store, log in to Fivem's KeyMaster site ([https://keymaster.fivem.net/](https://keymaster.fivem.net/)).

1. In the menu on the left, go to **Granted Assets** located in the **Server Owners** section.

Open the archive you just downloaded. There you will find a folder named **MS\_MadonnAdmin**.

4. Drag this folder into your server's resources folder.
5. Since the resource is already configured and ready to use, all you have to do is edit your server's configuration file (often caller _server.cfg_) and ad ensure _MS\_MadonnAdmin_ at the bottom of it.
