# First Launch

## Payment

When paying, it is imperative to provide a valid email address. This step is essential, as all information relating to the use of Madonn’Admin will be sent to this address. If you encounter a problem or have any questions, do not hesitate to contact our support via [Discord](https://discord.gg/madonne), where rapid assistance will be provided.

Make sure that the address entered is correct and accessible, so as not to miss any important communication. After validating your payment, an email will be automatically sent by our service (from noreply@madonnadmin.com) to the address provided. In the event that the email is not sent to you, please check that it has not been filtered into your junk mail or spam. If you still do not receive the email within a few minutes of validating the payment, contact our support without hesitation.

Keep the email received carefully, as it contains crucial information such as your identifiers or direct links to the documentation pages.

## Creating an account

When you have all your data linked to Madonn’Admin, you will be asked to create an account if this is not already done via the following link (insert link). This account will be the main entry point to manage your server. Once connected, your account will be automatically associated with your community.

It is important to keep your community ID safe. This identifier is unique and will be necessary for various administrative actions. This Token will be in the email sent by our services and will be presented in this form “x000xx0xx0xxx0xx00xx0xx0xx000xxx” but can also be found from your community settings, on Madonn’Admin.

## Main Settings

Once registered on Madonn’Admin, you will be guided through the initial setup by following the detailed instructions available in the [official documentation pages](configuration/dashboard-configuration/community-settings.md). These global settings are essential to ensure smooth operation and fully adapted to the needs of your community.

Once this setup is complete, you will be able to [create your server](configuration/dashboard-configuration/manage-servers.md) on Madonn’Admin. This step is the foundation of managing your community, by defining the basic structure.

After establishing your server, you will need to [create the necessary roles](configuration/dashboard-configuration/manage-permissions.md) for your moderators. These roles are crucial to effectively delegate responsibilities and maintain a clear organization within your team.&#x20;

In parallel, Madonn’Admin allows you to add members to your staff. This feature allows you to associate a player with your server, thus simplifying the tracking of their interactions and activities. You will also be able to assign specific roles to each player based on their responsibilities and the permissions you wish to grant them. These key steps ensure optimal and structured management of your community from the start.

## Add a new staff member

To add a player as a staff member in your community via Madonn’Admin, several conditions must be met and specific steps must be followed. These conditions guarantee a correct and secure association between the player and his profile on Madonn’Admin.

First, the player must have connected at least once to your server. This initial connection is essential, because it allows Madonn’Admin to recognize the player and automatically generate his profile in the platform.

Once this step is completed, you will need to send the player the community token associated with your community. This token, which is a unique key sent by our services when registering your community, must be entered correctly by the player in the settings of their Madonn’Admin account. This process is essential to establish a secure connection between the player and your community.

After the player has been identified by Madonn’Admin through their initial connection and the token has been correctly entered, you can finalize the association. Go to the player’s Madonn’Admin profile: a box appears under their nickname, indicating the nickname linked to their Madonn’Admin account. By clicking on this box, you can officially add the player to your community as staff.

This action creates a permanent link between the player and your community management, allowing you to assign them a role and manage their permissions. If you later wish to break this link, simply click on the "trash can" icon to delete the association.

At this point, although the player is now linked to your community, they do not yet have a specific role. To assign them a role that you have previously created (see the Madonn'Admin Configuration section for more details), the procedure is simple. Access the "Team Staffs" category on your Madonn'Admin interface, then go to the "Manage Staffs" section. Once in this space, you can select the server on which you wish to assign permissions, indicate the nickname of the staff concerned, and choose the role you wish to assign them. This approach ensures that each staff member has the appropriate rights to fulfill their functions within your community while maintaining a clear and structured organization.

Be sure to follow the official documentation to avoid any misunderstanding or problem when associating players to your community. In case of problems, we invite you to contact us via our discord. By following these steps, you will be able to easily add players to your staff and effectively manage their role and permissions via Madonn’Admin.
