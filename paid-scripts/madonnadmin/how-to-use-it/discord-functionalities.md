# Discord Functionalities

To begin with, several commands can be used on your Discord.

Note that the title of the different commands may differ depending on the language of the Discord.

This first command is the main tool that you will be able to use on Discord. It will allow you to access a player's basic information, their profile but also to apply sanctions to them in-game.

This command allows a player to access their Madonn'Admin profile, in particular to make requests for the removal of sanctions for example, consult their number of hours, etc.
