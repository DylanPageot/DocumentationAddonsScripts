# Players

This category offers two distinct subsections that allow complete and detailed management of players present or having been connected to the server. Search for a player and Show all players. These two features, although complementary, meet specific needs for smooth navigation and optimized supervision.

Search for a player. This first subsection is dedicated to a targeted and precise search. It allows you to quickly locate a specific player using different identification criteria. For example, you can enter the player's nickname, their in-game ID, or other information such as their Steam, Discord or Xbox ID (if these are associated with their account). This search greatly simplifies the identification process, especially when you are processing a large volume of data or need to quickly access a player's profile for administrative actions or verifications. Once the search is done, the results appear in the form of a structured list, providing direct access to the details of the selected player.

Show all players. The second subsection, on the other hand, gives you access to an overview of all the players registered or active on the server. This feature is particularly useful for obtaining an overview and analyzing member statistics or behavior. The list of players can include key information such as their nickname, in-game ID, total playing time, first login, current status (online or offline), and a summary of their sanctions (warnings, kicks, bans, etc.). To make it easier to explore and analyze this list, sorting options are available. You can sort the displayed columns (e.g. nicknames, IDs, or playing time) in ascending or descending order according to your needs. In addition, this section also offers an expanded display option, allowing you to change the number of results visible on a single page: the default setting is 10 players per page, but it can be adjusted to display up to 100 players at a time, depending on your preferences. You also have the option to click directly on the nicknames displayed in the Player Name column, which will allow you to quickly and easily access each player's detailed profile.

In short, these two subsections work together to give you complete control over server player management. Whether you need to quickly find a specific player through a targeted search or see a complete overview of all connected or registered members, this category brings together intuitive tools for simplified and efficient administrative management.

### Search for a player

Once you click on the Search Player button, you will see a detailed view, as shown below, which will be displayed directly on the page, allowing you to perform a quick and targeted search for players.

The Search Player section gives you the ability to find a player's Madonn'Admin profile using only their username. With this feature, you can quickly locate a specific player's account by entering their username as it appears on the server. Once the search is done, the system will direct you to the page shown below.

The Search by ID section allows you to locate a player's Madonn'Admin profile using various specific identifiers, thus offering a more flexible and detailed search. Unlike the search by username, which is limited to the username only, this feature gives you the ability to search for a player through several types of unique identifiers, such as their GTA 5 license, Discord ID, Steam ID, Xbox ID, or even Live ID. By default, the search is set to use the GTA 5 license as the main criteria, but it is easy to change this option according to your needs.

To do this, simply click on the part called "License" in the Identifier Name section, in order to choose the specific identifier you want to use for the search, and then enter the corresponding value in the field provided for this purpose. Once the identifier is entered and the search is launched, the system will provide you with the same detailed information as that obtained when searching by nickname. This includes essential data such as the player's profile, his statistics, his sanction history (as below).

### Show all players

Once you click on the Show All Players button, you will see a detailed display, as shown below, which will directly display on the page all the players present or having been present on the server.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this section, you will find a complete view of all players present or having visited the server, with a detailed list with various information for each player. Among the data displayed, you will find, in the "Player Name" column, the nickname of each player, which allows for quick identification. The "Playing Time" column tells you the total time spent by each player on the server, while the "First Connection" and "Last Connection" columns provide you with the exact dates of each player's first and last connections, thus providing an overview of their activity over time. In addition, the "Status" column tells you whether the player is currently online on the server or offline. The following columns, display the number of warns, kicks and bans each player has received, providing an overview of their behavior and sanction history on the server.

As with the other parts of the site, this list is not limited to a fixed number of results, by default up to 10 players are displayed, but you have the possibility to expand this list to display up to 100 players at a time, depending on your needs. In addition, at the top right of this section, you will find a search bar allowing you to search for a player directly by his nickname. This search feature is convenient and allows you to quickly find the profile of a specific player without having to browse the entire list.

Once you have found the player you were looking for in the list, simply click on his nickname to directly access his Madonn'Admin profile. This action will allow you to discover a multitude of information about this player, going far beyond simple basic statistics. You will be able to consult his complete history on the server, including his total playing time, his first and last connection dates, as well as his current status (whether the player is online or offline). The profile also provides information about their sanctions, such as warns, kicks, and bans received, allowing you to better understand their behavior and interactions with the server. In addition, you will be able to view other crucial data such as their recent activities, their in-game performance, as well as additional elements that can be useful for making administrative or moderation decisions.

This profile therefore offers you a complete overview of each player, giving you all the tools necessary to effectively manage and supervise activity on the server.

### Player profile

A player's profile on Madonn'Admin is divided into several distinct sections, each providing valuable information for the administrator.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The first section contains all the player's identifying information, including their Madonn'Admin credentials, such as their Discord account, Steam, FiveM license, Xbox ID, and other associated accounts. This data allows you to track all connections and profiles attached to the player on different platforms.

On the right side of the profile, you will find a set of detailed statistics about the player. This includes their current status, telling you whether they are online or offline on the server, as well as their first and last connections, giving you an overview of their activity on the server. You will also see their total playtime, a key piece of information to assess the player's engagement. Another important element is their trust score, which is an indicator calculated from the time played and the number of sanctions received by the player. The higher this score, the more reliable and trustworthy the player is considered, while a low score reflects a player with problematic behavior or a significant sanction history. Finally, flags, as mentioned earlier, appear here as well, indicating the player's reliability based on several criteria, namely his behavior, his sanctions, and his general history.

The player profile also includes a section to send a message directly to the player via Madonn'Admin. You can type a message in the "Enter a message" box, then send it to the player. This message will appear in the in-game chat, and will be visible only to the player concerned, just like announcement messages.

You also have access to a player's sanctions section, which displays the history of sanctions applied. This includes all infractions committed by the player, such as notes, warns, kicks, and bans..., providing a complete view of his behavior on the server. Next to each game, you will be shown the total number of sanctions the player has received per game.

As an administrator or with higher permissions, you also have access to the Appeals section, where you can see the player's requests for lifting sanctions, such as unban or lifting sanctions. By clicking on the clipboard icon next to the Appeals section, you can redirect the player to their Madonn'Admin page to allow them to make a request for lifting sanctions or review of their case. Once you have clicked on the clipboard, a link will be copied to your clipboard, you will just have to CTRL + V (paste) to send it to the player.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The player will see his Madonn’Admin profile as above and will be able to interact with his sanctions (if any) as in the example below.

Another essential part of the profile is the logs, which list all the actions performed by the player on the server. These logs include columns detailing the date and time of the actions, the Player Name with the player's nickname, the action performed (for example, death, injuries, etc.), and, if applicable, the nickname of the player who caused the incident (in the case of an injury or a murder). The display is designed to handle this situation by allowing you to view an expanded list. By default, up to 10 logs are displayed, but you can adjust this number to display up to 100 logs. Finally, a search bar is available to find the different information you are looking for more quickly.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeMaHjKKEMb9ufI3WEi3Azmclu2Mn0YPY6dXQeC5pg_o-8Ps-lVD3Zx1dbJn8oqPY1lRfgb_dBs69-IRm2EX3SIQnz04SqeXzALtyydaoWT0xa8zYMZwp9S016aPEaqquHXSPDX?key=fT9iLy8cgk4ZyBMLYLd8yr47" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Finally, the last section of the profile is dedicated to the application of sanctions. Here, you will be able to add notes on the player's profile by clicking on the Notes section, where you can enter your personal observations about the player. You can also add recommendations (these directly influence the player's trust score) by clicking on the Recommendation section.

By clicking Kick, you can apply an expulsion, entering the reason in the "Enter the content of the expulsion" box.

By clicking Warn, you will be able to apply a warning by entering the reason for the warning in the "Enter warning content" box.

If you feel the punishment should be harsher, you can go to the Ban section and apply a ban, where you can set the ban duration (ranging from minutes to community ban, with minutes being the default) and enter the reason for the ban in the corresponding box.
