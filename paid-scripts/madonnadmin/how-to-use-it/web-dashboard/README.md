This centralized tool allows you to view and analyze in real time information such as detailed logs of actions performed on the server, performance statistics, the number of connected players, etc.

Thanks to an intuitive interface, Madonn’Admin Web facilitates the monitoring of events, whether connections, executed commands, or specific alerts. The administration can also track valuable data on player engagement, activity peaks, and resource status to better understand and anticipate the needs of the community.

In addition, the platform offers advanced analysis tools to quickly identify potential problems, monitor suspicious behavior, and maintain a secure and efficient gaming environment. Madonn’Admin Web is thus positioned as a tool for any administrator wishing to efficiently manage their FiveM server while offering an optimal experience to their players.

When you click on your community name, it automatically redirects you to the dashboard, which is the main and default interface of the site. This dashboard is the central navigation point, allowing you to quickly and efficiently access all the essential features offered by the platform. It acts as an intuitive and structured landing page, where you can find at a glance key information on the status of your server, the main statistics or the latest activities in progress. This redirection feature greatly simplifies navigation, giving you smooth and immediate access to the landing page, and allows you to save valuable time by eliminating intermediate steps to return to this central point.

The player search feature integrated into Madonn’Admin Web offers a powerful and fast tool to access the Madonn’Admin profile of a particular player. Thanks to this search bar, you can efficiently find a profile by entering various identifiers associated with the player. For example, you can enter the player’s nickname used on the server for direct access to their information. In addition, the search supports several types of identifiers, such as Discord IDs associated with the player’s account, Steam IDs that allow you to link your profile to your main gaming platform, as well as Xbox IDs, if they are also connected to the account.

This flexibility in search criteria guarantees maximum accessibility, regardless of the type of data you have to identify a player. By facilitating a quick and precise search, this feature becomes an essential tool for administrators looking to monitor, analyze or manage player profiles in an efficient and organized manner.

When you perform a search for a player, the Madonn’Admin Web system will show you a structured and detailed result that will look like the example illustrated below.

The displayed result usually includes essential information about the player, such as their username, the total time they have spent on the server, the date of their last connection as well as the date of their first connection. You will also be able to see their current status, indicating whether they are online or offline, as well as data regarding their sanction history, such as the number of Warns, Kicks, and bans they have received. In case of multiple players sharing the same nickname, the display is designed to handle this situation by allowing you to view an expanded list. By default, up to 10 profiles are displayed, but you can adjust this number to display up to 100 players to more easily browse the results and identify the desired profile. This presentation ensures clear and detailed data management, facilitating your searches even in complex situations.

#### RIGHT PART

The various features located in the upper right corner of the interface offer convenient options to customize and manage your experience on Madonn’Admin Web.

The logout function, meanwhile, allows you to exit your session securely.

#### LEFT BOTTOM CORNER

The display located in the lower left corner of the site interface fulfills an informative and practical role by grouping several visual and functional elements. First of all, it presents the emblematic Madonn’Admin logo, symbolizing the identity of the platform.
