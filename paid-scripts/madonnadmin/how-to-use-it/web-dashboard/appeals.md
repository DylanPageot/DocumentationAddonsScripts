# Appeals

The appeals section is a key feature that is only accessible to members with the rank of administrator or higher. These appeals, which mainly concern requests for unbanning or lifting of sanctions, are presented in the form of a structured table, designed to allow for clear, efficient and rapid management of these requests.

The table includes several key columns, each providing specific information about each appeal: Request ID: This column lists the unique identifiers assigned to each request, making them easier to track and manage. Player Name: Displays the nickname of the player the request is about, allowing them to be immediately identified. Sanction Type: Indicates the nature of the sanction the player is seeking to challenge or have lifted, whether it is a warning, temporary ban, or other disciplinary measure. Request Status: Specifies the current status of the request, distinguishing between appeals marked as new, requiring immediate attention, and those marked as in progress, already being handled by a member of the administration. Request Date: This column provides the date and time the appeal was submitted, allowing requests to be organized and prioritized based on their age.

These requests are made by players seeking a second chance.

In order to make a request for an unban or a withdrawal of sanction, the player must click on the little man with the square. This is present on the sanctions of the player's locker. It should be noted that the Man (i.e. the unban request) can only be made from a given time in the Madonn'Admin settings. By default, the time is 2 months.

When the player clicks on the logo several things will be asked of him. First of all in the Submitting an Appeal section. (as below)

The player will therefore have to choose from the different types of calls (as in the image on the right). And fill in the request in the player's argumentation section.



### Opened appeals

The table includes several key columns, each providing specific information about each appeal: Request ID: This column lists the unique identifiers assigned to each request, making them easier to track and manage. Player Name: Displays the nickname of the player the request is about, allowing them to be immediately identified. Sanction Type: Indicates the nature of the sanction the player is seeking to challenge or have lifted, whether it is a warning, temporary ban, or other disciplinary measure. Request Status: Specifies the current status of the request, distinguishing between appeals marked as new, requiring immediate attention, and those marked as in progress, already being handled by a member of the administration. Request Date: This column provides the date and time the appeal was submitted, allowing requests to be organized and prioritized based on their age.

When you click on one of the requests in the appeals section, a new dedicated page opens, designed to offer a complete and detailed overview of the player concerned as well as information relating to his request. This page is organized into five distinct blocks, each structured to allow for a clear and efficient management of the request, providing all the elements necessary for an informed decision.

Player Information: This first block contains all the player’s identifying data and general statistics. Here you will find their nickname, associated identifiers such as their Discord, Steam ID, or any other relevant identifier (such as their FiveM license or Xbox Live ID). In parallel, this section also includes key information about the player’s history, including their first login, last login, and total playtime on the server. These elements help to better understand the player’s engagement and seniority in the community. \[See image below]

Sanction Information: This second block provides a detailed view of the sanction that the player is contesting. It includes the type of sanction (e.g., warning, temporary ban, or permanent ban), the expiration date if applicable, and the time remaining before the ban expires. Additionally, this section specifies the name of the staff that applied the sanction and the reason why it was implemented, in order to understand the context of the initial decision. \[See image below]

Appeal Information: This third block is specifically dedicated to the player’s request. It includes the information provided by the player when submitting the appeal, including the type of appeal (e.g., request for sanction reduction or full contest), the current status of the appeal (new or ongoing), and the player’s detailed argument, i.e., their explanations or justifications for requesting a review of the sanction. \[See image below]

Player Records: This fourth block is a detailed history of past sanctions involving the player. It presents all the sanctions recorded against him, whether they are notes, recommendations, warnings, expulsions, or bans. If the staff is an administrator or has the necessary permissions, this section also includes the previous appeals made by the player, allowing to have an overview of his behavior and history.

Conclusion of the appeal: Finally, the last block focuses on the resolution of the request. Two buttons are available there, allowing to validate or reject the appeal. These options give administrators the possibility to make a final decision based on the information provided in the other blocks.

In short, this page is designed to centralize all the useful data concerning the player and his appeal, thus facilitating a structured and well-documented decision-making process. It combines transparency, traceability and efficiency, ensuring that each request is treated with the seriousness it deserves.

### Closed appeals

When you access and click on the section titled Closed Appeals, a new page will automatically open, displaying a summary table specifically designed to consolidate all relevant information regarding past requests for lifting of sanctions. This table serves as a historical reference for appeals that have already been processed, whether they were accepted or denied.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The table is organized into several structured columns to make it easier to read and search for information. You will find in particular: The request identifier: A unique number assigned to each call, allowing you to easily identify a specific request among all the cases processed. The player name: This column displays the pseudonym of the player concerned by the call, allowing you to immediately know who initiated the request. The type of sanction: This section specifies the nature of the sanction for which the call was made, for example, a warning, a temporary exclusion (kick), or a ban. The status of the appeal: Here you will find the final outcome of the request, indicated by a clear status such as “Accepted” if the sanction was lifted or reduced, or “Refused” if the request was not accepted. The resolution date: This column displays the precise date on which the request was processed and finalized, whether it was accepted or refused, allowing you to keep a temporal record of the decisions taken.

In addition to this information, this table is designed to be consulted quickly and efficiently thanks to sorting options. You can organize the data alphabetically (for example, by player names), by type of request, or by resolution date, in order to quickly locate a specific request.

You can also click on one of the lines to access the old requests in order to have additional monitoring of the requests made. By clicking this will take you to a new page grouping all the information concerning the request (as for the open appeals).

This space plays a key role as a centralized archive for closed appeals, offering a transparent and complete overview of the decisions made by the administrative team. Whether it is to analyze trends in sanctions, check the history of a player, or simply ensure administrative follow-up, this functionality is particularly valuable.
