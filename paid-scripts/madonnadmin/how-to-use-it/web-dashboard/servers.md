# Servers

The Servers category plays a key role in using Madonn’Admin Web by giving you the ability to select and manage the server on which you want to perform various actions or view specific data. With this feature, you can define the active server among those linked to your account, allowing for smooth navigation and targeted access to relevant information. Once the server is selected, this category gives you access to a wide range of management options and tools tailored to the server.

The section at the top of the page, titled with the name of your server, offers quick and comprehensive access to a set of crucial information and statistics, designed to provide you with a clear and detailed view of the activity on your server. This section works similarly to the Dashboard, but is specifically dedicated to the selected server. Among the information displayed, you will be able to view the total number of players currently connected, allowing you to monitor the server activity live.

At the same time, the section also highlights the number of staff members present online, which is essential to assess whether the management is sufficient to manage interactions and possible incidents that occur on the server. In addition, this part provides detailed statistics on the actions of staff members, such as warns, kicks and bans carried out over a given period, allowing you to monitor the effectiveness and activity of the moderation. All the data displayed in this section is updated each time you refresh the page. In short, this part dedicated to the selected server is an essential complement to the Dashboard, offering specific and contextualized information for optimized management.

The Online Players section is an essential tool to view and manage information about players currently connected to your server. It offers you a detailed list of players present, accompanied by various useful data to ensure precise monitoring and optimal management. Among the information displayed for each player, you will be able to see their nickname, their in-game ID, their total playing time, as well as the date of their first connection to the server. In addition, their status is indicated to confirm whether they are currently online or offline, and you will also have an overview of any sanctions they have received, such as warns, kicks or bans. This section also offers an advanced data sorting feature. By clicking on the column headings such as “PLAYER NAME”, “IN-GAME ID”, “GAME TIME”, “FIRST CONNECTION”, “STATUS”, “WARN”, “KICK” or “BAN”, you can sort the information in ascending or descending order, according to your needs. This allows you to quickly search for specific players or sort the data for further analysis. In addition, this section integrates a search bar located in the upper right corner, which makes it even easier to identify players. Here you can enter either a player's nickname or their in-game ID to quickly locate the profile you are looking for. As with other parts of the interface, this section includes a handy feature to manage the display of the player list. By default, a maximum of 10 players are presented on the page, but you have the possibility to expand this list to display up to 100 players simultaneously, depending on your preferences and management needs.

This flexibility ensures simplified navigation and effective supervision, even in situations where many players are active on the server.

The Additional Information section offers essential tools to strengthen the management and supervision of your server, providing direct access to two main features: an admin chat and a list of flags of connected players.

The admin chat is a space dedicated to exchanges between staff members. You will find all the messages sent from the admin chat directly in-game, which allows you to follow the discussions and decisions made by the team in real time. Better still, this interface allows you to interact directly from the site, by sending messages that will be immediately visible in the admin chat in-game. This feature ensures smooth and efficient communication between administrators, even for those who are not connected to the server in-game.

The section dedicated to player flags provides detailed information on the behavior of members currently present on the server. These flags are generated from the analysis of several parameters, such as the history of sanctions (warns, kicks, bans), their frequency, and their playing time. Thanks to this system, it is possible to quickly distinguish reliable players, who exhibit exemplary or rarely sanctioned behavior, from less reliable players, characterized by a significant number of sanctions. This visual classification allows the staff to more closely monitor players who are likely to cause problems.

It is important to note that if no players are connected to the server, the flags section will remain empty. However, as soon as players join the server, all flags will be automatically displayed in this section, with a clear and organized presentation, as illustrated below.

In summary, the Additional Information section combines communication tools with advanced behavioral indicators to give administrators and staff greater control over player interactions and behaviors on the server.

The Broadcast Message section is specifically designed to allow for quick and efficient communication with all players connected to your server. This feature gives you the ability to send a global message to all players, directly visible in the in-game chat. These messages, identified by a clear designator in the format “Your server name: \[Your message]”, are designed to attract players’ attention and convey important information in a uniform and professional manner. By default, broadcast messages appear in blue in the chat, but this color can be customized to suit your preferences or your server’s visual identity. In addition, this section offers pre-configured buttons for frequently used messages, making it quick and easy to broadcast essential reminders. Among these standard messages, you will find options such as reminders to encourage players to use the report command in case of problems, a notification to read or reread the server rules, a direct link to the official community Discord, announcements specifying the times of regular server restarts, or other messages. They are fully customizable, allowing you to add, edit, or remove announcements according to the evolving needs of your community.

Meanwhile, the right side of this interface has a similar structure to the Additional Information section of the dashboard. It is used to display the latest announcements published by the server managers. This integration ensures that you and your team are constantly informed about essential internal communications.

In short, the Broadcast Message section stands out for its versatility and customization, combining practical tools for global communication with advanced features for efficient management of interactions with players and staff.

The last section of this page offers advanced features and information exclusively accessible to users with the Admin rank, providing them with specific tools for the in-depth management of requests and sanctions. This part is divided into two main subsections, Open Appeals and Pending Sanctions, each addressing specific monitoring and decision-making needs. Open Appeals. This subsection provides an overview of ban requests or sanction removal requests submitted by players through the appeals system. Closely related to the Appeals category, it allows admins to have a quick and clear overview of pending requests. For each request, several key pieces of information are displayed, including: The request ID (# column), which uniquely identifies it. The type of request (Type column), specifying whether it is an appeal for a ban lift, a warning lift, or any other administrative request. The status of the request (status column), indicating whether it is being processed or has not yet been handled by a staff member. With this overview, administrators can easily assess the urgency and nature of calls, allowing for faster and more efficient management of situations.

Pending sanctions. The second subsection is dedicated to sanctions awaiting validation, which concern decisions requiring the approval of an administrator. These sanctions come from staff members who, due to limited permissions, cannot directly apply bans. In this section, several columns allow you to detail each pending sanction: “Player” column: Displays the nickname of the player concerned by the sanction. “Reason” column: Indicates the precise reason justifying the proposed sanction, providing context for the decision to be made. “Sanction” column: Specifies the duration or type of sanction applied, whether it is a warning, a kick or an extended ban. “Apply” column: Presents two options in the form of interactive buttons to finalize the decision: A green button, to immediately approve and validate the sanction. A red button, to refuse the sanction if it is deemed unjustified or inappropriate.

This layout allows administrators to efficiently manage pending sanctions, while providing greater control over the decisions made by the entire moderation team. It centralizes both the processing of player appeals and the validation of sanctions proposed by staff members, ensuring consistent application of the server rules.
