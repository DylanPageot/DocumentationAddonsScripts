# Main Page

The Dashboard interface represents the main and central section of Madonn’Admin Web, serving as a starting point and home page where all the key information is grouped for quick and efficient management. It is structured in three main axes, each designed to provide accurate and useful data to server administrators and moderators.

The first axis, called Dashboard, presents an overall overview of the server’s activities over the last seven days. You will find essential indicators such as the number of players currently connected, which allows you to know in real time the activity of the server. This section also displays the number of players who have joined the server in the last seven days, a valuable indicator to evaluate the growth and engagement of your community. In addition, it provides the number of staff members currently online, essential to organize supervision and support on the server, as well as a summary of the actions carried out by the staff in the last seven days, such as warnings, bans or expulsions.

The second axis, titled Online Staff, provides a detailed view of the currently active team members. This section not only displays the total number of staff members online, but also additional information such as the server they are on, their rank (admin, moderator, etc.), and their status indicating whether they are in moderation or roleplay mode. This section also includes a handy feature to display an expanded list of staff members: by default, it displays up to 10 results, but can be adjusted to display up to 100 members depending on your needs.

Finally, the third axis, titled Additional Information, gathers additional data and important announcements for the staff. Here you will find the latest communications and updates intended for the admin team, ensuring that you stay informed of new guidelines or events. This section also includes information related to player flag activity, which allows you to monitor and report specific or suspicious behavior among players currently connected to the server. Thanks to this organization into three clear and functional axes, the Dashboard interface becomes an essential tool for centralizing and analyzing the data essential to the daily management of your FiveM server.
