The logs interface is presented as illustrated above and is deployed in the form of a structured and organized table, designed to accurately record the various activities of the players present on the server. Each page of this interface is neatly divided into several columns, grouping together essential information that allows to track and analyze the events that occurred in the server environment. These columns include: Date/Time: This column records the exact moment when each action was performed, providing precise chronological traceability of events. It allows to easily follow the sequence of actions of the players, whether it is their interactions or the decisions made by the system or the moderators. Player Pseudo: This section displays the names or pseudonyms of the players concerned by the logged actions. It allows to quickly identify who is at the origin of an activity or who is affected by it, thus facilitating research and verification. Player Actions: Here, we find a clear description of the actions performed by each player, whether they are interactions with other players, in-game activities, or triggering specific events. Details: This column provides additional information on the actions listed, adding details that help to better understand the context. For example, if a player was involved in a fight, this section could include information on the other participants or the exact consequences of this interaction.

These logs constitute a complete and detailed record, similar to that available on the Madonnâ€™Admin profiles of players. However, the particularity here is that this is not data limited to a single user, but rather a global vision encompassing all the players present or having interacted on the server. This interface is designed to offer a clear overview, facilitating the work of administrators and moderators. They can not only monitor players' activities in real time, but also access a complete history that allows them to perform in-depth checks or analyses.

In addition, the interface is often equipped with additional features to simplify navigation and use. For example, it is possible to sort the data according to columns, by ordering events chronologically, alphabetically (based on pseudonyms), or by filtering according to the types of actions listed. This allows you to quickly search for specific information or spot anomalies in player behavior.
