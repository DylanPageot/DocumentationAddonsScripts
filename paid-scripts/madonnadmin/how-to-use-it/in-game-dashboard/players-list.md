# Players list

When you click on the third button in the sidebar, you will access an interface that displays the complete list of players currently connected to the server. This list is presented in the form of a detailed table, grouping together several key pieces of information for each player. You will find their nickname, their current in-game ID, their cumulative playing time on the server, as well as the dates of their first connection. In addition, the table also includes a summary of the sanctions applied to each player, such as warnings, temporary exclusions (kicks) or bans.

The interface has been designed to allow you to navigate smoothly and quickly. If you want to know more about a specific player, simply click on their nickname. This action directly opens their Madonn’Admin profile, accessible from the in-game menu. On this profile, you can view additional information about the player, such as their detailed statistics, their connection history, and any past sanctions.

In addition, this interface allows you to interact directly with the player in several ways thanks to a series of purple buttons, each dedicated to a specific action. You can, for example, teleport to the player's position, teleport to his vehicle, or teleport the player to your position. It is also possible to send him back to his initial position, repair his vehicle (only if he is driving), heal the player, revive him if necessary, or even kill him. You also have the possibility, for exemple (buttons are customizables), to freeze or unfreeze his character, handcuff him or free him from his handcuffs, apply the "ragdoll" effect (which makes the character fall in a disjointed manner), or refuel his vehicle if he is the driver.

In addition, this interface includes a detailed view of the player's sanction history, where you can consult the warnings, kicks, bans, and other sanctions that have been applied to him. You also have the option to apply new sanctions directly from this in-game menu, using the same options and features as those available on the Madonn’Admin web interface.
