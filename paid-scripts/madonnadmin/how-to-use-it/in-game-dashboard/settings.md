The penultimate icon in the moderation menu gives you access to a feature dedicated to the targeted deletion of objects and vehicles present on the server. By accessing this section, you can define a specific radius of action in which you wish to perform this deletion. This radius determines the area around your position in which the selected items will be deleted, giving you precise control to avoid any unwanted deletion outside the area concerned. Once you have configured the radius using the available options, simply click on the arrow located at the purple frame to validate and apply the action. This process will trigger the deletion of the selected items in the defined area. The menu offers you two main categories of items to delete: Objects: This includes all prop-type objects generated on the server, whether they are dropped by players or from scripts. Vehicles: This concerns both vehicles belonging to players and those generated by NPCs or left abandoned in the area.

With this system, you can effectively manage server congestion, remove unwanted items that could cause slowdowns, bugs or annoy other players. This feature is particularly useful in situations where many unnecessary objects or vehicles accumulate quickly, such as during events or specific interventions requiring localized cleaning.

You will also have, if the permissions are set to this, access to two options: underwater mode and god mode. These options will allow respectively:

* To hide your presence as being in active staff from players
* To remove or not your god mode (by default activated when switching to active staff)
