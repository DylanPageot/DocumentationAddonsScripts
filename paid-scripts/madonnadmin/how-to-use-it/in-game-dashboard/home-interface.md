When you activate the menu to take your service as a moderator, the first page that appears is a detailed dashboard designed to provide you with an overview of essential information. This page centralizes several important elements (as above). First, it presents a complete list of staff members currently connected to the server. This list, organized in a clear and readable table, includes several precise columns such as the nickname of the staff members, allowing quick identification, their rank in the team (as moderator, administrator, or any other role), as well as their current status, indicating whether they are in moderation activity or in roleplay. That is, whether they have their menu in moderation mode or not.

In addition, this page includes a section dedicated to the latest announcements posted by managers or team leaders, thus providing quick access to internal communications or important information. These announcements can include reminders, updates on procedures or specific guidelines to follow.

Finally, another essential component of this interface is an interactive and visual graph that compiles the flags of the players connected to the server. This graph provides a clear and immediate overview of the players, highlighting their potential problematic behaviors or notable infractions. This graphic presentation allows staff members to prioritize their actions according to the severity of the situations identified.

This page therefore constitutes an essential starting interface for any member of staff entering service, offering a combination of strategic and operational information to effectively manage the server.
