When you are in-game and want to activate your moderation service mode, the procedure is simple and intuitive. All you have to do is press the "F10" key, which is assigned by default for this action. However, if this key does not suit you or if you prefer a different configuration, know that it is entirely possible to modify it directly in the system settings. This customization allows you to adapt to your personal preferences and your comfort of use, guaranteeing an optimized user experience.

Once you have pressed the designated key, the system is automatically activated and you are immediately redirected to a dedicated interface. In addition, when activating the latter, you will automatically be put in GodMod (invisible) and you will have, above your character, an indicator showing that you are staff. The indicator in question is a message with your nickname: \[ACTIVE STAFF] Staff nickname. This interface is specifically designed for moderators and administrators, allowing you to quickly access all the features needed to effectively manage in-game interactions.

The rank management system has been designed with a strict hierarchy in order to ensure a clear organization and a limitation of the information accessible at each level. More precisely, it is configured in such a way that members of a lower rank, such as moderators, do not have the possibility to view or interact with the data, tools or actions specific to higher ranks, such as administrators or super administrators.

The interface that appears corresponds to the one shown in the image below. It has been designed to be clear and ergonomic, bringing together the essential tools and information necessary for your moderation missions. You will find various options to follow the activities in progress on the server, intervene with players if necessary, or access important data, such as logs and player profiles.

To navigate efficiently through the different sections of your moderation menu, you have a series of icons located on the sidebar on the left of the interface. These icons are designed to provide quick and intuitive access to all the main features. Here is a detailed description of their usefulness:

The house icon, located at the top of the bar, represents the home interface or entry page of the menu. This is where you arrive by default when taking your shift. This page provides essential information, such as the list of connected staff members and recent announcements.

The third icon from the top gives you access to the list of players currently on the server. By clicking on it, you can consult a detailed table containing key information about each connected player, such as their nickname, their playing time or their status.

The fifth icon, meanwhile, is dedicated to accessing the general server logs. These logs gather the history of actions performed on the server, allowing a global view of recent events and facilitating the monitoring of player activities.

The seventh icon, in the shape of a cog, redirects you to the settings section. This section is essential for interacting with props and NPCs.

Finally, the last icon in the list, located at the bottom of the bar, is a button for reloading the current page. This feature is particularly useful for quickly refreshing the information displayed, such as player data or logs.
