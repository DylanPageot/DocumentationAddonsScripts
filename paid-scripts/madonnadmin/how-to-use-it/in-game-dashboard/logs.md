By clicking on the fifth button in the menu, you access an interface dedicated to displaying server logs, structured in a similar way to that available on the web version of Madonnâ€™Admin. This section offers you a detailed and organized view of the different actions recorded on the server. You can filter the logs according to specific categories to meet your needs. For example, you can choose to display only connections, messages sent, weapon shots, injuries suffered or inflicted, player deaths, or explosions that took place on the server.

This information is presented in the form of a table, comprising several columns for clear and efficient reading. The Date/Time column indicates precisely when the action was performed, while the Player Pseudo column identifies the player involved. The Player Action column describes the event or interaction performed, and the Details column provides additional information on the context or circumstances of the action.

This logging system allows you to monitor, analyze, and understand server events with high precision, while providing an intuitive interface to filter and sort data according to your needs. This feature is particularly useful for tracking specific incidents, assessing player behavior, or detecting suspicious activities.
