# In Game Commands

In addition to the many features offered by Madonn’Admin, several practical commands are available to facilitate your in-game interventions and optimize your player management. These commands, which are executed directly via the discussion chat, allow you to quickly interact with players and manage their positions on the server. Here are the main accessible commands and their detailed use:

* /goto + \[ID]: This command allows you to teleport directly to a specific player. To use it, enter /goto followed by the ID of the player concerned. This feature is particularly useful for quickly intervening in an ongoing situation.
* /bring + \[ID]: By entering this command followed by the player’s ID, you can teleport the player to your current position. If you want to manage several players at once, you can add several identifiers separated by spaces. For example, /bring 10 20 30 will simultaneously teleport players with IDs 10, 20 and 30 to your position. This command is particularly useful for grouping players together.
* /return + \[ID] : This command gives you the ability to return a player or group of players to their initial position before they were teleported. By typing /return followed by the ID of the player or players concerned, you can restore their previous location, ensuring a smooth flow of movement. For example, if a player was teleported for a discussion, you can place them back where they were, avoiding any confusion or disorientation.

These commands provide great flexibility and increased responsiveness for staff members, allowing them to interact effectively with players according to the needs of the server.
