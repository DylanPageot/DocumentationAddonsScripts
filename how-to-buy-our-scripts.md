# How to buy our scripts ?

You may have visited one of our servers once. If so, you must have noticed the amount of exclusive scripts specific to our server. In order to share our work and allow you to create your server with quality resources, we have decided to make part of our work available to you. All our scripts are sold exclusively on our Tebex store, intended for addons and scripts, which you can find at the following address: https://scripts.madonnestudio.com/.



### Why buy our scripts ?

Game server creators, we cannot know better the needs that a server receiving many players can have. We are therefore constantly looking for functionality that can be useful to each of you.

Each of our scripts and resources are tested before being published, on servers with more than a hundred connected players. This helps identify any potential issues during large-scale use or when OneSync is enabled. As a result, all of our scripts are OneSync compatible.



### What should you do to acquire a script ?

{% hint style="info" %}
**DISCLAIMER : All our resources are protected by the FiveM ESCROW system in order to protect our work and make it last over time. This therefore requires going through the CFX.RE site to download the resources and only the servers using a FiveM key belonging to you can use the resource.**
{% endhint %}

1. Visit our store and select the different resources that may interest you.
2. Log in using your CFX account, so you can ensure the proper delivery of the resource.
3. If you wish, you can also connect to Discord to simplify your support requests on our Discord.
4. If you wish to acquire paid resources, proceed to payment to validate your order.
5. The resources will then be available for download on FiveM's KeyMaster : https://keymaster.fivem.net/ . By going to the **Granted Assets** section, you can find the resources you have just acquired in order to download them.
